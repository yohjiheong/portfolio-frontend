# portfolio-frontend

There will be another folder name Project-Skate. 
It is made based on the topic - Things I'm interested in. 
I am very interested in skating, and due to covid I don't have the chance to go outdoor and skate, so I decided to take Skate Boarding as my topic.

This is a front end only portfolio I made in school. It uses bootstrap and also a JS framework. 
As this is a very beginner work, I will keep it updated and improve in the future.

Thanks! :D
